open Mlisp_object

(** Initialize the base environment with primitive functions and core bindings.

    Creates the foundation environment that contains all built-in MLisp functions
    and essential symbols. This environment serves as the root for all MLisp
    program execution and provides access to core language primitives.

    The initialization process:
    1. Creates a fresh hash-table based environment
    2. Binds the empty symbol for string operations
    3. Loads all primitive function collections (numeric, string, standard)
    4. Returns the fully populated base environment

    This module is critical for bootstrapping the MLisp interpreter and
    establishing the core language functionality.
*)

(** The base environment containing all MLisp primitive functions and symbols.

    This environment includes:
    - Arithmetic operations (Num.basis)
    - String manipulation functions (String.basis)
    - Core Lisp operations (Std.basis)
    - Essential symbols like "empty-symbol"

    All MLisp programs start with this environment as their foundation.
